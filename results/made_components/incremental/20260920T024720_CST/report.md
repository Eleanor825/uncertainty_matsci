# Incremental MADE completed-result update

Observed **2026-09-20T02:47:20.330199+08:00**. **395/1080** registered evaluations have original completed receipts. This is an overlapping snapshot, not additional experiments.

| Arm | Accepted | Failed | Claimed, unfinished | Reserved, unknown | Unclaimed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline_reference | 99 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 169 |
| uq_only_support_aware | 93 | 0 | 7 | 0 | 170 |
| es_only_independent | 103 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 166 |
| full_support_aware | 100 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 162 |

Only completed matched task/budget/seed pairs enter comparisons. Pending, failed and unknown rows remain without metrics. Within-configuration sample variance uses evaluation seeds; incomplete seed sets are labelled and n<2 variance is blank. Negative results and original failure hashes are retained.

These current matching sets vary across arms and snapshots. Their means are not full-matrix effects or evidence of a causal NN contribution. The two ES policies were trained separately. The original seed1 180-run study and SnAr are separate.

Verification checks fixed production registration hashes, original receipt seals, exact result/claim hashes, registered job identity, complete curves and candidate counts. It does not reload models or rerun original raw-trajectory acceptance. Reading is sequential while other jobs continue.

Recompute this export with `python3 -B recompute.py`. Original completed-result hashes and all1080 status rows are retained; no credentials or process/operator records are published.
